        Navigation Controllers are a new feature for the web platform that let a script persistently cache resources and handle all resource requests for an application -- even when the network isn't available. Putting it all together, Navigation Controllers give you a way to build applications that work offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Navigation Controllers provide the lower-level primitives that AppCache might be described in terms of. Navigation Controllers, then, are the explanation for the magic of AppCache.

            Some of the terms used in this specification are defined in [<a href="https://github.com/slightlyoff/DOMPromise/">Promises</a>], [<a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#requests">Fetch</a>], [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE]],

                    Delay treating the installing controller until the passed Promise resolves
                    successfully. This is primarily used to ensure that a NavigationController is not 
                    active until all of the "core" Caches it depends on are populated.
